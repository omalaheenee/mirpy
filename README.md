# mirpy #
Collection of python scripts to work with miRNA

* [GeneAFinder][1] - script for the semi-automatic extraction and arrangement of updated information on gene and aditional data from published article abstracts in PubMed
* [miRAFinder][1] - script for the semi-automatic extraction and arrangement of updated information on miRNA and additional data from published article abstracts in PubMed
* [TmiROSite][2] - script allows for retrieving a set of additional sequences at left and at right from the miRNA binding site located in CDS of mRNA and translate this nucleotide fragment in ORF
* [TmiRUSite][2] - script allows for retrieving a set of additional sequences at left and at right from the miRNA binding site located in 5'UTR and 3'UTR of mRNAs
